            <p>The key to a healthy diet is to eat the right amount of calories for how active you are so you
                balance the energy you consume with the energy you use.If you eat or drink more than your body
                needs, you'll put on weight because the energy you do not use is stored as fat. If you eat and drink
                too little, you'll lose weight.
